<h2>What this is</h2>
<p>This is a front-end mentor challenge in which you make a two way lay-out, one for desktop screens and the latter for mobile.</p>
<p>It's a basic single card layout it doesn't have much to it. I added a little hover to the title.</p>

<h2>Achievements</h2>
<p>With this project I managed to learn about background image overlay using the filter property and learning about it's values</p>
<p>I nailed this design almost to a tea.</p>
<p>I gained a better understanding of Nesting</p>
<p>Troubleshooted and carefully debugged issues that I was having. </p>

<h2>End</h2>
<p>I won't bore you with every step of the process but those were the main things I learned.</p>
<p>I want to keep it pushing and keep the momentum alive, I'll put more effort into writing a better README.md going forward.</p>
